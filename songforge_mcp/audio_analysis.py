"""Real audio measurement (BPM, key) via librosa.

Promoted from ad-hoc scratch scripts used during live debugging of the
vocal-stem + new-instrumental workflow into a proper, reusable capability.
The point: BPM/Key values fed into generate_vocal_track's
advanced_settings should come from actually measuring a reference clip,
never from a person (or the calling model) guessing per-song.

Deliberately does NOT attempt chord-progression detection. A DSP
chord-template matcher was tried and measured (bar-synchronous chroma +
major/minor triad templates) - its overall key call was actually correct
(confirmed against a real chord chart for a real, identified song), but
its chord-by-chord output ("C# - B - D#m...") did not match that song's
real, published chords ("Gb - Db - Ab - Bbm") and was rejected by ear as
not fitting the vocal. For a remix workflow specifically, the real chords
are knowable directly - the source song is real and (for anything with an
online chord chart) has a real, correct progression already documented -
so guessing them from audio via DSP is the wrong tool for that job. The
calling model should identify the song and look up its real chord chart
using its own general web search/fetch capability, then feed that real
progression into generate_vocal_track's caption directly. This module
still measures BPM/key from audio - a much better-established, more
reliable DSP task than chord recognition - as a cross-check or for audio
with no identifiable song/online source (e.g. private, unreleased
recordings).
